# 🌐 Personal Portfolio – Vite + React + Tailwind

This is a simple, one-page **personal portfolio website** built using **Vite React**. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills, projects, and a little bit about myself – kind of like a digital business card on the web.

I built this as a personal side project to improve my frontend skills and to have an online space that represents me.

## 🚀 Overview

The website is structured into several main sections:

- **Hero Section** (Home/Welcome)  
  A bold introduction with a short welcome message.

- **Skills Section**  
  Highlights my technical proficiency across:
  - Frontend tools
  - Backend knowledge
  - Development tools & other relevant skills

- **Projects Section**  
  A showcase of some of the projects I've worked on, displayed in a smooth carousel.

- **About Me**  
  A brief section to introduce who I am and what I’m passionate about.

- **Contact Me**  
  A simple section with contact details or links to reach out.

> Note: Currently this is a **single-page site**, but I might expand it later with project detail pages.
